=== SYSTEM ===
You are an expert in space medicine, bioinformatics, and multi-omics data analysis. You are answering questions about spaceflight biomedical data from the SpaceOmicsBench benchmark, which includes data from the Inspiration4 (I4) 3-day mission and the NASA Twins Study (340-day ISS mission).

When answering:
1. Be specific and cite relevant statistics when available from the provided context
2. Distinguish between what the data shows versus your interpretation
3. Express uncertainty appropriately, especially given the extremely small sample sizes (N=4 for I4, N=1 for Twins)
4. Consider multi-omics integration and cross-mission comparisons where relevant
5. Do not fabricate statistics, gene names, or citations not present in the provided context

## Data Context

# Spatial Transcriptomics Data

## Dataset
- **Source**: Inspiration4 skin biopsies
- **Genes**: 18,677 measured across skin tissue layers
- **Layers analyzed**: outer_epidermis, inner_epidermis, epidermis (combined), outer_dermis, vasculature

## All-Skin DE Analysis (Feature Source)
- Baseline DE statistics computed across entire skin tissue
- Features per gene: baseMean, log2FoldChange, lfcSE (standard error)
- These all-skin features serve as input for layer-specific prediction

## Layer-Specific DE (Labels)
- Separate DE analysis per skin layer
- Significance threshold: adjusted p-value < 0.05
- Positive counts: outer_epidermis ~35, epidermis ~40, inner_epidermis ~15, outer_dermis ~18

## Benchmark Tasks
- **E1**: Cross-layer DE prediction (outer_epidermis) — Advanced
  - N=18,677, positives=35 (0.19%), AUPRC, Best: LogReg=0.017
- **E4**: Cross-layer DE prediction (epidermis) — Advanced
  - N=18,677, positives=~40 (0.21%), AUPRC, Best: LogReg=0.023
- **E2**: Cross-layer DE (inner_epidermis) — Supplementary/Frontier
  - Extreme imbalance (~15 positives), metric instability expected
- **E3**: Cross-layer DE (outer_dermis) — Supplementary/Frontier
  - Extreme imbalance (~18 positives), Best: RF=0.223

## Key Observations
- Extreme class imbalance (0.1-0.2% positive rate) necessitates AUPRC metric
- All-skin DE features have limited power for predicting layer-specific effects
- Skin is directly exposed to space radiation; layer-specific responses may reflect depth-dependent radiation exposure
- E2/E3 are supplementary due to metric instability from very few positives

# Ground Truth Key Facts

## Mission Facts
- I4: 4 civilian crew, 3 days LEO (~585 km), September 2021, SpaceX Dragon
- NASA Twins: 340 days ISS, Scott Kelly vs Mark Kelly (twin control), 2015-2016
- JAXA CFE: 6 astronauts, >120 days ISS, cell-free RNA epigenome

## Benchmark Statistics
- 21 ML tasks: 19 main + 2 supplementary (E2, E3)
- 9 categories: Clinical, cfRNA, Proteomics, Metabolomics, Spatial, Microbiome, Multi-modal, Cross-tissue, Cross-mission
- Tiers: Calibration=1, Standard=5, Advanced=9, Frontier=6

| I1 | Frontier | LightGBM | 0.006 |
| I2 | Advanced | LightGBM | 0.735 |
| I3 | Advanced | LogReg | 0.090 |

## Composite Scores (Normalized)
- RF: 0.258 (best overall)
- XGBoost: 0.250
- LightGBM: 0.238
- LogReg: 0.201
- MLP: 0.133

## Cross-Mission Facts
- 146/452 pathways conserved between I4 and Twins (32.3%)
- 814/15,540 genes show conserved DE (5.2%)
- 57 hemoglobin/erythropoiesis genes in the dataset
- HBB shows ~40% post-flight expression increase

## Key Limitations
- N=4 crew (I4), N=1 treatment (Twins) — extremely small sample sizes
- 3-day mission may not capture chronic adaptation effects
- LOCO evaluation stringent but low-N means high variance
- Cross-mission comparisons confounded by different platforms, crews, and durations

**Question (medium):** Why do the spatial transcriptomics tasks (E1-E4) have such extreme class imbalance, with positive rates below 1%? What does this tell us about cross-layer differential expression in skin?
