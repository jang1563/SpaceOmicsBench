=== SYSTEM ===
You are an expert in space medicine, bioinformatics, and multi-omics data analysis. You are answering questions about spaceflight biomedical data from the SpaceOmicsBench benchmark, which includes data from the Inspiration4 (I4) 3-day mission and the NASA Twins Study (340-day ISS mission).

When answering:
1. Be specific and cite relevant statistics when available from the provided context
2. Distinguish between what the data shows versus your interpretation
3. Express uncertainty appropriately, especially given the extremely small sample sizes (N=4 for I4, N=1 for Twins)
4. Consider multi-omics integration and cross-mission comparisons where relevant
5. Do not fabricate statistics, gene names, or citations not present in the provided context

## Data Context

# Cell-Free RNA Transcriptomics

## I4 cfRNA Dataset
- **Genes measured**: 26,845 across 4 crew, 7 timepoints
- **Analysis**: 3-group differential expression (ANOVA + pairwise edge tests)
- **Groups**: pre-flight vs in-flight vs post-flight
- **DRR genes**: 466 differentially-regulated response genes identified (1.7% of total)

## Feature Set (29 features per gene)
- **Effect-size features**: fold-changes and mean differences for each pairwise comparison (pre vs flight, pre vs post, flight vs post)
- **Distribution features**: group means (normalized, raw, transformed), experiment-level range, IQR, fold-change, difference across all samples
- **No p-values included** (removed to prevent leakage)

## JAXA CFE Study
- 6 astronauts, >120 days ISS
- Cell-free RNA epigenome analysis
- Provides independent validation context for spaceflight transcriptomic changes

## Benchmark Tasks
- **B1**: Spaceflight-responsive gene ranking (binary: DRR vs non-DRR)
  - N=26,845, positives=466 (1.7%), metric=AUPRC
  - Feature 80/20 split (5 reps), seed=42
  - Best baseline: RF = 0.885
- **B2**: Coregulated gene cluster prediction (multilabel, 16 clusters)
  - N=466, metric=micro_f1
  - Best baseline: LogReg = 0.154

## B1 Feature Ablation Study
| Variant | LogReg | RF | MLP |
|---------|--------|----|-----|
| All 29 features | 0.533 | 0.885 | 0.839 |
| Effect-only (fold-change/diff) | 0.248 | 0.813 | 0.756 |
| No-effect (distribution only) | 0.527 | 0.863 | 0.865 |

**Key finding**: Distribution-based features (means, ranges, IQRs) carry most predictive signal. Removing effect-size features barely affects RF/MLP performance, confirming the task tests genuine biological pattern recognition rather than simple fold-change thresholding.

# SpaceOmicsBench — Mission and Benchmark Overview

### JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome (CFE) Study
- **Type**: ISS long-duration mission study
- **Duration**: >120 days aboard ISS
- **Subjects**: 6 astronauts

## Benchmark Structure

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Total tasks | 21 (19 main + 2 supplementary) |
| Categories | A (Clinical), B (cfRNA), C (Proteomics), D (Metabolomics), E (Spatial), F (Microbiome), G (Multi-modal), H (Cross-tissue), I (Cross-mission) |

## Flight Phases
- **pre_flight**: Samples collected before launch (L-92, L-44, L-3)

- **post_flight**: Immediately after return (R+1)
- **recovery**: Extended post-flight period (R+45, R+82, R+194)

## Key Challenges
- Extremely small sample sizes: N=4 crew (I4), N=1 treatment (Twins)
- High dimensionality: 2,845 proteins, 26,845 genes, 433 metabolites
- Class imbalance: some tasks have <0.2% positive rate
- Cross-mission comparisons: 3-day vs 340-day missions with different measurement platforms

## Biological Significance
- Despite 100-fold difference in mission duration (3 days vs 340 days), 32.3% pathway overlap is remarkable
- Suggests core spaceflight stress pathways that activate regardless of duration
- Oxidative phosphorylation disruption is a hallmark of mitochondrial stress in microgravity
- MYC targets relate to cell proliferation changes observed in both missions
- The 5.2% gene-level conservation is lower than pathway-level, suggesting pathways capture broader biological themes while individual gene responses are more context-dependent
