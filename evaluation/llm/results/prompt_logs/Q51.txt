=== SYSTEM ===
You are an expert in space medicine, bioinformatics, and multi-omics data analysis. You are answering questions about spaceflight biomedical data from the SpaceOmicsBench benchmark, which includes data from the Inspiration4 (I4) 3-day mission and the NASA Twins Study (340-day ISS mission).

When answering:
1. Be specific and cite relevant statistics when available from the provided context
2. Distinguish between what the data shows versus your interpretation
3. Express uncertainty appropriately, especially given the extremely small sample sizes (N=4 for I4, N=1 for Twins)
4. Consider multi-omics integration and cross-mission comparisons where relevant
5. Do not fabricate statistics, gene names, or citations not present in the provided context

## Data Context

# Multi-Omics Integration and Cross-Tissue Analysis

## G1: Multi-Modal Phase Classification
- **Modalities fused**: Clinical (CBC + CMP) + Proteomics (PCA) + Metabolomics (PCA)
- **Matched samples**: 21 (only timepoints where all 3 modalities were collected)
- **Feature construction**:
  - Clinical: ~40 raw CBC + CMP features
  - Proteomics: PCA of 2,845 proteins → 8 components
  - Metabolomics: PCA of metabolite matrix → 8 components
  - Total: ~56 fused features (PCA applied per-fold to prevent data leakage)
- **Task**: 3-class phase classification (pre_flight / post_flight / recovery)
- **Evaluation**: LOCO (4-fold), macro_f1
- **Results**: LogReg=0.517, MLP=0.285, RF=0.254

## H1: Cross-Tissue Gene Conservation (PBMC → Skin)
- **Question**: Do PBMC DE patterns predict skin DE?
- **N**: 731 genes tested in both PBMC and skin
- **Features**: 9 I4 PBMC cell type log2FC values (CD4_T, CD8_T, other_T, B, NK, CD14_Mono, CD16_Mono, DC, other)
- **Target**: Whether gene is also significantly DE in skin (binary)
- **Metric**: AUPRC
- **Results**: RF=0.266, LogReg=0.176, MLP=0.062

## Key Observations
- Multi-modal fusion (G1) improves over single-modality approaches, but small N (21) limits gains
- PCA is necessary for proteomics and metabolomics (p >> n) but loses interpretability
- LOCO evaluation with N=21 means each fold tests on ~5 samples from one crew
- Cross-tissue conservation (H1) shows moderate signal: some genes respond systemically to spaceflight across both blood and skin
- RF best for H1, suggesting nonlinear relationships between PBMC cell type effects and skin DE

# SpaceOmicsBench — Mission and Benchmark Overview

## Benchmark Summary
SpaceOmicsBench is a multi-omics AI benchmark for spaceflight biomedical data, featuring 21 ML tasks across 9 modalities from three human spaceflight studies.

## Missions

### Inspiration4 (I4)
- **Type**: SpaceX commercial crew mission, first all-civilian orbital spaceflight
- **Date**: September 15-18, 2021
- **Duration**: ~3 days in low Earth orbit (LEO, ~585 km altitude)
- **Crew**: 4 civilians (C001-C004), no prior spaceflight experience
- **Sample collection**: 7 timepoints — L-92, L-44, L-3 (pre-flight), R+1 (post-flight), R+45, R+82, R+194 (recovery)
- **Modalities collected**: CBC, CMP, cytokines, cfRNA, proteomics (plasma + EVP), metabolomics, spatial transcriptomics (skin), microbiome (10 body sites + ISS environmental)
- **Data source**: NASA OSDR (OSD-569 to OSD-687)

### JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome (CFE) Study
- **Type**: ISS long-duration mission study
- **Duration**: >120 days aboard ISS
- **Subjects**: 6 astronauts
- **Focus**: Cell-free RNA epigenome analysis
- **Data source**: NASA OSDR (OSD-530)

### NASA Twins Study
- **Type**: Year-long ISS mission with identical twin control
- **Date**: March 2015 - March 2016
- **Duration**: 340 days aboard ISS
- **Subjects**: Scott Kelly (space, N=1) vs Mark Kelly (ground control, N=1)
- **Blood cell analysis**: Single-cell RNA-seq of CD4, CD8, CD19, PBMC, LD (lymphocyte-depleted)
- **Contrasts analyzed**: 21 different coefficients (In-flight vs Pre-flight, Post-flight vs Pre-flight, etc.)
- **Total DEG entries**: 115,493 across all cell types and contrasts (19,446 unique genes)

## Benchmark Structure

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Total tasks | 21 (19 main + 2 supplementary) |
| Categories | A (Clinical), B (cfRNA), C (Proteomics), D (Metabolomics), E (Spatial), F (Microbiome), G (Multi-modal), H (Cross-tissue), I (Cross-mission) |
| Difficulty tiers | Calibration (1), Standard (5), Advanced (8), Frontier (7) |
| Evaluation strategies | LOCO (leave-one-crew-out), LOTO (leave-one-timepoint-out), Feature 80/20 (stratified) |
| ML baselines | Random, Majority, LogReg, RF, MLP |

## Flight Phases
- **pre_flight**: Samples collected before launch (L-92, L-44, L-3)
- **in_flight**: During spaceflight (I4 only ~3 days; Twins ~340 days)
- **post_flight**: Immediately after return (R+1)
- **recovery**: Extended post-flight period (R+45, R+82, R+194)

## Key Challenges
- Extremely small sample sizes: N=4 crew (I4), N=1 treatment (Twins)
- High dimensionality: 2,845 proteins, 26,845 genes, 433 metabolites
- Class imbalance: some tasks have <0.2% positive rate
- Cross-mission comparisons: 3-day vs 340-day missions with different measurement platforms
