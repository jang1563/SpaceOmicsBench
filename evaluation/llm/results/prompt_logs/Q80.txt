=== SYSTEM ===
You are an expert in space medicine, bioinformatics, and multi-omics data analysis. You are answering questions about spaceflight biomedical data from the SpaceOmicsBench benchmark, which includes data from the Inspiration4 (I4) 3-day mission and the NASA Twins Study (340-day ISS mission).

When answering:
1. Be specific and cite relevant statistics when available from the provided context
2. Distinguish between what the data shows versus your interpretation
3. Express uncertainty appropriately, especially given the extremely small sample sizes (N=4 for I4, N=1 for Twins)
4. Consider multi-omics integration and cross-mission comparisons where relevant
5. Do not fabricate statistics, gene names, or citations not present in the provided context

## Data Context

# Spatial Transcriptomics Data

## Dataset
- **Source**: Inspiration4 skin biopsies
- **Genes**: 18,677 measured across skin tissue layers
- **Layers analyzed**: outer_epidermis, inner_epidermis, epidermis (combined), outer_dermis, vasculature

## All-Skin DE Analysis (Feature Source)
- Baseline DE statistics computed across entire skin tissue
- Features per gene: baseMean, log2FoldChange, lfcSE (standard error)
- These all-skin features serve as input for layer-specific prediction

## Layer-Specific DE (Labels)
- Separate DE analysis per skin layer
- Significance threshold: adjusted p-value < 0.05
- Positive counts: outer_epidermis ~35, epidermis ~40, inner_epidermis ~15, outer_dermis ~18

## Benchmark Tasks
- **E1**: Cross-layer DE prediction (outer_epidermis) — Advanced
  - N=18,677, positives=35 (0.19%), AUPRC, Best: LogReg=0.017
- **E4**: Cross-layer DE prediction (epidermis) — Advanced
  - N=18,677, positives=~40 (0.21%), AUPRC, Best: LogReg=0.023
- **E2**: Cross-layer DE (inner_epidermis) — Supplementary/Frontier
  - Extreme imbalance (~15 positives), metric instability expected
- **E3**: Cross-layer DE (outer_dermis) — Supplementary/Frontier
  - Extreme imbalance (~18 positives), Best: RF=0.223

## Key Observations
- Extreme class imbalance (0.1-0.2% positive rate) necessitates AUPRC metric
- All-skin DE features have limited power for predicting layer-specific effects
- Skin is directly exposed to space radiation; layer-specific responses may reflect depth-dependent radiation exposure
- E2/E3 are supplementary due to metric instability from very few positives

# Space Anemia and Hemoglobin Pathway

## Background
Space anemia is a well-documented consequence of spaceflight. Key findings from literature:
- ~54% more red blood cells destroyed in space compared to ground (Trudel et al., Nature Medicine 2022)
- Hemolysis continues for at least 1 year post-flight
- Compensatory erythropoiesis upregulates hemoglobin-related genes

## Hemoglobin Gene Set
- **Total genes**: 59 hemoglobin/erythropoiesis pathway genes
- **Key genes**: HBA1, HBA2 (alpha-globins), HBB (beta-globin), HBBP1, ALAS2 (rate-limiting erythropoiesis enzyme)
- **Overlap with DE data**: 57 of 59 genes found in the 26,845-gene Twins DE dataset

## Expression Data (from gt_hemoglobin_globin_genes.csv)
- 59 genes measured across 4 crew and 11 timepoints (Pre1-3, Flight1-4, Post1-4)
- HBB expression: normalized means range from ~11,000 (Flight2) to ~33,000 (Post4), showing ~40% post-flight increase
- HBA1 and HBA2 show similar patterns: decreased during flight, increased post-flight
- ALAS2 (aminolevulinic acid synthase 2): key rate-limiting enzyme for heme biosynthesis

## Cross-Mission DE (Task I1)
- **Features**: 3 fold-change values from Twins transcriptome (Pre vs Flight FC, Pre vs Post FC, Flight vs Post FC)
- **Target**: Whether gene is in the 57 hemoglobin/erythropoiesis gene set
- **N=26,845**, positives=57 (0.21%)
- **Metric**: AUPRC
- **Difficulty**: Frontier — only 3 features with extreme class imbalance
- **Baseline results**: RF=0.005, LogReg=0.003 (near random=0.003)

## Biological Interpretation
- Alpha-globin (HBA1, HBA2) and beta-globin (HBB) are the main oxygen-carrying proteins in hemoglobin
- Spaceflight causes splenic hemolysis → compensatory upregulation of erythropoiesis genes
- The post-flight increase is consistent with recovery response: body producing new RBCs to replace those lost in space
- ALAS2 upregulation confirms active heme biosynthesis pathway activation
- Cross-mission consistency (both I4 and Twins show hemoglobin pathway activation) suggests this is a universal spaceflight response

# SpaceOmicsBench — Mission and Benchmark Overview

## Benchmark Summary
SpaceOmicsBench is a multi-omics AI benchmark for spaceflight biomedical data, featuring 21 ML tasks across 9 modalities from three human spaceflight studies.

## Missions

**Question (expert):** Skin is the outermost organ and receives different radiation doses at different depths. How might the gradient of cosmic radiation exposure explain the pattern of DE genes across skin layers (outer_epidermis > epidermis > inner_epidermis ≈ outer_dermis)?
