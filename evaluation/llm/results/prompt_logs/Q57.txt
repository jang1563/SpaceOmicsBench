=== SYSTEM ===
You are an expert in space medicine, bioinformatics, and multi-omics data analysis. You are answering questions about spaceflight biomedical data from the SpaceOmicsBench benchmark, which includes data from the Inspiration4 (I4) 3-day mission and the NASA Twins Study (340-day ISS mission).

When answering:
1. Be specific and cite relevant statistics when available from the provided context
2. Distinguish between what the data shows versus your interpretation
3. Express uncertainty appropriately, especially given the extremely small sample sizes (N=4 for I4, N=1 for Twins)
4. Consider multi-omics integration and cross-mission comparisons where relevant
5. Do not fabricate statistics, gene names, or citations not present in the provided context

## Data Context

# Multi-Omics Integration and Cross-Tissue Analysis

## G1: Multi-Modal Phase Classification
- **Modalities fused**: Clinical (CBC + CMP) + Proteomics (PCA) + Metabolomics (PCA)
- **Matched samples**: 21 (only timepoints where all 3 modalities were collected)
- **Feature construction**:
  - Clinical: ~40 raw CBC + CMP features
  - Proteomics: PCA of 2,845 proteins → 8 components
  - Metabolomics: PCA of metabolite matrix → 8 components
  - Total: ~56 fused features (PCA applied per-fold to prevent data leakage)
- **Task**: 3-class phase classification (pre_flight / post_flight / recovery)
- **Evaluation**: LOCO (4-fold), macro_f1
- **Results**: LogReg=0.517, MLP=0.285, RF=0.254

## H1: Cross-Tissue Gene Conservation (PBMC → Skin)
- **Question**: Do PBMC DE patterns predict skin DE?
- **N**: 731 genes tested in both PBMC and skin
- **Features**: 9 I4 PBMC cell type log2FC values (CD4_T, CD8_T, other_T, B, NK, CD14_Mono, CD16_Mono, DC, other)
- **Target**: Whether gene is also significantly DE in skin (binary)
- **Metric**: AUPRC
- **Results**: RF=0.266, LogReg=0.176, MLP=0.062

## Key Observations
- Multi-modal fusion (G1) improves over single-modality approaches, but small N (21) limits gains
- PCA is necessary for proteomics and metabolomics (p >> n) but loses interpretability
- LOCO evaluation with N=21 means each fold tests on ~5 samples from one crew
- Cross-tissue conservation (H1) shows moderate signal: some genes respond systemically to spaceflight across both blood and skin
- RF best for H1, suggesting nonlinear relationships between PBMC cell type effects and skin DE

# Clinical Biomarker Data

## Dataset
- **Source**: Inspiration4 mission, 4 civilian crew (C001-C004)
- **Samples**: 28 total (4 crew × 7 timepoints)
- **Phase distribution**: pre_flight=12, post_flight=4, recovery=12

## CBC (Complete Blood Count) — 20 features
Absolute counts: basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils
Percentages: basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils
Red cell indices: hematocrit, hemoglobin, MCH, MCHC, MCV, RBC count, RDW
Platelets: platelet count, MPV
White cells: WBC count

## CMP (Comprehensive Metabolic Panel)
Standard metabolic markers measured at same timepoints as CBC.

## Cytokines/Immune Markers — 71 features
EVE (extravehicular exposure) cytokine panel including inflammatory markers, growth factors, and chemokines. Measured in serum at all 7 timepoints.

## Benchmark Tasks
- **A1**: Flight phase classification from CBC + CMP features (3-class: pre/post/recovery)
  - Metric: macro_f1, LOCO evaluation (4-fold)
  - Best baseline: LogReg = 0.546
- **A2**: Flight phase classification from immune/cytokine markers (3-class)
  - Metric: macro_f1, LOCO evaluation (4-fold)
  - Best baseline: LogReg = 0.493

## Key Observations
- Post-flight class has only 4 samples (one per crew at R+1), creating severe imbalance
- CBC features show acute changes at R+1 including shifts in neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios
- LogReg outperforms RF and MLP, likely due to small N favoring simpler models
- LOCO evaluation is stringent: each fold tests on an entirely unseen crew member

# Proteomics Data

## Plasma Proteomics
- **Samples**: 21 (4 crew × ~5-6 timepoints, plasma tissue)
- **Proteins measured**: 2,845
- **DE analysis**: 1,686 proteins with differential expression statistics (logFC, AveExpr, t-statistic, B-statistic, adj_pval)

## EVP (Extracellular Vesicle Particle) Proteomics
- **DE analysis**: 496 proteins with DE statistics
- **Overlap with plasma**: 380 proteins measured in both biofluids

## Benchmark Tasks
- **C1**: Proteomics phase classification (3-class: pre/post/recovery)
  - N=21 samples, per-fold PCA reduction (2,845 proteins → 10 components)
  - Metric: macro_f1, LOCO evaluation (4-fold)
  - Best baseline: MLP = 0.517
- **C2**: Cross-biofluid protein DE concordance (frontier difficulty)
  - Predict EVP significance from plasma DE features
  - N=380 overlapping proteins, metric=AUROC
  - Best baseline: LightGBM = 0.565 (barely above random 0.529)

## Key Observations
- p >> n problem: 2,845 proteins vs 21 samples requires PCA dimensionality reduction
- C1 achieves reasonable classification despite tiny N, suggesting strong proteomic shifts during spaceflight
- C2 is frontier difficulty — plasma and EVP protein changes show weak concordance, reflecting different biological compartments
- EVP cargo represents active cellular secretion, while plasma includes both secreted and leaked proteins

# Metabolomics Data

## Dataset
- **Source**: Inspiration4 mission
- **Metabolites**: 433 measured across 4 crew, multiple timepoints
- **Analytical modes**: ANP-POS and RP-POS mass spectrometry
- **Spaceflight-responsive**: 91/433 metabolites (21%) show significant DE

## Features per Metabolite
- **Mass**: molecular mass from MS
- **RT**: retention time
- **annotation_confidence**: quality of metabolite identification
- **SuperPathway**: broad metabolic category
- **SubPathway**: specific metabolic pathway
- **Formula**: chemical formula (decomposed into C, H, N, O, S, P atom counts)

## Benchmark Task
- **D1**: Metabolite spaceflight response prediction (binary)
  - N=433, positives=91 (21%), metric=AUROC
  - Feature 80/20 split (5 reps)
  - Best baseline: RF = 0.676

## Key Observations
- Moderate positive rate (21%) makes this amenable to AUROC evaluation
- Chemical structure features (atom counts) provide physicochemical context
- Pathway annotations enable biological interpretation of predictions
- Short-duration (3-day) metabolomic changes likely reflect acute stress response rather than chronic adaptation
