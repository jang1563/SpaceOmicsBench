You are an expert in space medicine, bioinformatics, and multi-omics data analysis. You are answering questions about spaceflight biomedical data from the SpaceOmicsBench benchmark, which includes data from the Inspiration4 (I4) 3-day mission and the NASA Twins Study (340-day ISS mission).

When answering:
1. Be specific and cite relevant statistics when available from the provided context
2. Distinguish between what the data shows versus your interpretation
3. Express uncertainty appropriately, especially given the extremely small sample sizes (N=4 for I4, N=1 for Twins)
4. Consider multi-omics integration and cross-mission comparisons where relevant
5. Do not fabricate statistics, gene names, or citations not present in the provided context

## Data Context

# Microbiome Data

## Dataset
- **Source**: Inspiration4 mission
- **Human samples**: 275 from 10 body sites across 4 crew, 7 timepoints
- **Environmental samples**: 39 from ISS surfaces
- **Human gut samples**: 8
- **Feature types**: Taxonomy-level CPM and Pathway-level CPM (MetaPhlAn/HUMAnN)

## Body Sites (10 sites, ~27-28 samples each)
EAR (ear canal), NAC (nasal cavity), ORC (oral cavity), PIT (axilla), TZO (toe zone), WEB (toe web), ARM (forearm), GLU (gluteal), NAP (nape), UMB (umbilicus)

## Benchmark Tasks
- **F1**: Body site classification from taxonomy (10-class) — Standard
  - N=275, LOCO, macro_f1, Best: RF=0.199
- **F2**: Flight phase detection from taxonomy (4-class) — Frontier
  - N=275, LOCO, macro_f1, Best: RF=0.238
- **F3**: Human vs environmental classification (binary) — Calibration
  - N=314, LOTO (7-fold), AUROC, Best: RF=0.841
- **F4**: Body site classification from pathways (10-class) — Standard
  - N=275, LOCO, macro_f1, Best: LogReg=0.163
- **F5**: Flight phase detection from pathways (4-class) — Frontier
  - N=275, LOCO, macro_f1, Best: RF=0.254

## Key Observations
- F3 is the only calibration-tier task (RF=0.841) — human vs ISS environment microbiomes are highly distinguishable
- Flight phase detection (F2, F5) is frontier difficulty — microbiome changes during 3-day spaceflight are subtle
- Body site classification achieves modest performance — 10-class problem with limited taxonomic resolution
- Taxonomy and pathway features give similar results for body site but slightly different for phase detection

**Question (easy):** How many body sites are sampled in the I4 microbiome dataset, and how many total samples are collected from human versus environmental sources?
