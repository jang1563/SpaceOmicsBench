=== SYSTEM ===
You are an expert in space medicine, bioinformatics, and multi-omics data analysis. You are answering questions about spaceflight biomedical data from the SpaceOmicsBench benchmark, which includes data from the Inspiration4 (I4) 3-day mission and the NASA Twins Study (340-day ISS mission).

When answering:
1. Be specific and cite relevant statistics when available from the provided context
2. Distinguish between what the data shows versus your interpretation
3. Express uncertainty appropriately, especially given the extremely small sample sizes (N=4 for I4, N=1 for Twins)
4. Consider multi-omics integration and cross-mission comparisons where relevant
5. Do not fabricate statistics, gene names, or citations not present in the provided context

## Data Context

# Clinical Biomarker Data

## Dataset
- **Source**: Inspiration4 mission, 4 civilian crew (C001-C004)
- **Samples**: 28 total (4 crew × 7 timepoints)
- **Phase distribution**: pre_flight=12, post_flight=4, recovery=12

## CBC (Complete Blood Count) — 20 features
Absolute counts: basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils
Percentages: basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils
Red cell indices: hematocrit, hemoglobin, MCH, MCHC, MCV, RBC count, RDW
Platelets: platelet count, MPV
White cells: WBC count

## CMP (Comprehensive Metabolic Panel)
Standard metabolic markers measured at same timepoints as CBC.

## Cytokines/Immune Markers — 71 features
EVE (extravehicular exposure) cytokine panel including inflammatory markers, growth factors, and chemokines. Measured in serum at all 7 timepoints.

## Benchmark Tasks
- **A1**: Flight phase classification from CBC + CMP features (3-class: pre/post/recovery)
  - Metric: macro_f1, LOCO evaluation (4-fold)
  - Best baseline: LogReg = 0.546
- **A2**: Flight phase classification from immune/cytokine markers (3-class)
  - Metric: macro_f1, LOCO evaluation (4-fold)
  - Best baseline: LogReg = 0.493

## Key Observations
- Post-flight class has only 4 samples (one per crew at R+1), creating severe imbalance
- CBC features show acute changes at R+1 including shifts in neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios
- LogReg outperforms RF and MLP, likely due to small N favoring simpler models
- LOCO evaluation is stringent: each fold tests on an entirely unseen crew member

# Ground Truth Key Facts

## Mission Facts
- I4: 4 civilian crew, 3 days LEO (~585 km), September 2021, SpaceX Dragon
- NASA Twins: 340 days ISS, Scott Kelly vs Mark Kelly (twin control), 2015-2016
- JAXA CFE: 6 astronauts, >120 days ISS, cell-free RNA epigenome

## Benchmark Statistics
- 21 ML tasks: 19 main + 2 supplementary (E2, E3)
- 9 categories: Clinical, cfRNA, Proteomics, Metabolomics, Spatial, Microbiome, Multi-modal, Cross-tissue, Cross-mission
- Tiers: Calibration=1, Standard=5, Advanced=9, Frontier=6

## Baseline Results (Best per Task)
| Task | Tier | Best Model | Score |
|------|------|-----------|-------|
| A1 | Standard | LogReg | 0.546 |
| A2 | Standard | LogReg | 0.493 |
| B1 | Advanced | LightGBM | 0.922 |
| B2 | Advanced | LogReg | 0.154 |
| C1 | Standard | MLP | 0.517 |
| C2 | Frontier | LightGBM | 0.565 |
| D1 | Advanced | RF | 0.676 |
| E1 | Advanced | LogReg | 0.017 |
| E4 | Advanced | LogReg | 0.023 |
| F1 | Standard | LightGBM | 0.200 |
| F2 | Frontier | LightGBM | 0.280 |
| F3 | Calibration | RF | 0.841 |
| F4 | Standard | LogReg | 0.163 |
| F5 | Frontier | LightGBM | 0.304 |
| G1 | Advanced | LogReg | 0.517 |
| H1 | Advanced | LightGBM | 0.285 |
| I1 | Frontier | LightGBM | 0.006 |
| I2 | Advanced | LightGBM | 0.735 |
| I3 | Advanced | LogReg | 0.090 |

## Composite Scores (Normalized)
- RF: 0.258 (best overall)
- XGBoost: 0.250
- LightGBM: 0.238
- LogReg: 0.201
- MLP: 0.133

## Cross-Mission Facts
- 146/452 pathways conserved between I4 and Twins (32.3%)
- 814/15,540 genes show conserved DE (5.2%)
- 57 hemoglobin/erythropoiesis genes in the dataset
- HBB shows ~40% post-flight expression increase

## Key Limitations
- N=4 crew (I4), N=1 treatment (Twins) — extremely small sample sizes
- 3-day mission may not capture chronic adaptation effects
- LOCO evaluation stringent but low-N means high variance
- Cross-mission comparisons confounded by different platforms, crews, and durations

**Question (medium):** The post-flight class in A1 has only 4 samples (one per crew at R+1), while pre-flight has 12 and recovery has 12. How does this extreme class imbalance affect macro_f1 evaluation, and why was macro_f1 chosen over accuracy?
