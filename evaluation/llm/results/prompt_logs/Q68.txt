=== SYSTEM ===
You are an expert in space medicine, bioinformatics, and multi-omics data analysis. You are answering questions about spaceflight biomedical data from the SpaceOmicsBench benchmark, which includes data from the Inspiration4 (I4) 3-day mission and the NASA Twins Study (340-day ISS mission).

When answering:
1. Be specific and cite relevant statistics when available from the provided context
2. Distinguish between what the data shows versus your interpretation
3. Express uncertainty appropriately, especially given the extremely small sample sizes (N=4 for I4, N=1 for Twins)
4. Consider multi-omics integration and cross-mission comparisons where relevant
5. Do not fabricate statistics, gene names, or citations not present in the provided context

## Data Context

# Proteomics Data

## Plasma Proteomics
- **Samples**: 21 (4 crew × ~5-6 timepoints, plasma tissue)
- **Proteins measured**: 2,845
- **DE analysis**: 1,686 proteins with differential expression statistics (logFC, AveExpr, t-statistic, B-statistic, adj_pval)

## EVP (Extracellular Vesicle Particle) Proteomics
- **DE analysis**: 496 proteins with DE statistics
- **Overlap with plasma**: 380 proteins measured in both biofluids

## Benchmark Tasks
- **C1**: Proteomics phase classification (3-class: pre/post/recovery)
  - N=21 samples, per-fold PCA reduction (2,845 proteins → 10 components)
  - Metric: macro_f1, LOCO evaluation (4-fold)
  - Best baseline: MLP = 0.517
- **C2**: Cross-biofluid protein DE concordance (frontier difficulty)
  - Predict EVP significance from plasma DE features
  - N=380 overlapping proteins, metric=AUROC
  - Best baseline: LightGBM = 0.565 (barely above random 0.529)

## Key Observations
- p >> n problem: 2,845 proteins vs 21 samples requires PCA dimensionality reduction
- C1 achieves reasonable classification despite tiny N, suggesting strong proteomic shifts during spaceflight
- C2 is frontier difficulty — plasma and EVP protein changes show weak concordance, reflecting different biological compartments
- EVP cargo represents active cellular secretion, while plasma includes both secreted and leaked proteins

# Multi-Omics Integration and Cross-Tissue Analysis

## G1: Multi-Modal Phase Classification
- **Modalities fused**: Clinical (CBC + CMP) + Proteomics (PCA) + Metabolomics (PCA)
- **Matched samples**: 21 (only timepoints where all 3 modalities were collected)
- **Feature construction**:
  - Clinical: ~40 raw CBC + CMP features
  - Proteomics: PCA of 2,845 proteins → 8 components
  - Metabolomics: PCA of metabolite matrix → 8 components
  - Total: ~56 fused features (PCA applied per-fold to prevent data leakage)
- **Task**: 3-class phase classification (pre_flight / post_flight / recovery)
- **Evaluation**: LOCO (4-fold), macro_f1
- **Results**: LogReg=0.517, MLP=0.285, RF=0.254

## H1: Cross-Tissue Gene Conservation (PBMC → Skin)
- **Question**: Do PBMC DE patterns predict skin DE?
- **N**: 731 genes tested in both PBMC and skin
- **Features**: 9 I4 PBMC cell type log2FC values (CD4_T, CD8_T, other_T, B, NK, CD14_Mono, CD16_Mono, DC, other)
- **Target**: Whether gene is also significantly DE in skin (binary)
- **Metric**: AUPRC
- **Results**: RF=0.266, LogReg=0.176, MLP=0.062

## Key Observations
- Multi-modal fusion (G1) improves over single-modality approaches, but small N (21) limits gains
- PCA is necessary for proteomics and metabolomics (p >> n) but loses interpretability
- LOCO evaluation with N=21 means each fold tests on ~5 samples from one crew
- Cross-tissue conservation (H1) shows moderate signal: some genes respond systemically to spaceflight across both blood and skin
- RF best for H1, suggesting nonlinear relationships between PBMC cell type effects and skin DE

- 814/15,540 genes show conserved DE (5.2%)
- 57 hemoglobin/erythropoiesis genes in the dataset
- HBB shows ~40% post-flight expression increase

## Key Limitations
- N=4 crew (I4), N=1 treatment (Twins) — extremely small sample sizes
- 3-day mission may not capture chronic adaptation effects
- LOCO evaluation stringent but low-N means high variance
- Cross-mission comparisons confounded by different platforms, crews, and durations

**Question (medium):** Task C1 applies PCA to reduce 2,845 proteins to 10 components before classification. Why is PCA applied per-fold rather than on the entire dataset, and what artifact would arise from applying PCA before splitting?
