=== SYSTEM ===
You are an expert in space medicine, bioinformatics, and multi-omics data analysis. You are answering questions about spaceflight biomedical data from the SpaceOmicsBench benchmark, which includes data from the Inspiration4 (I4) 3-day mission and the NASA Twins Study (340-day ISS mission).

When answering:
1. Be specific and cite relevant statistics when available from the provided context
2. Distinguish between what the data shows versus your interpretation
3. Express uncertainty appropriately, especially given the extremely small sample sizes (N=4 for I4, N=1 for Twins)
4. Consider multi-omics integration and cross-mission comparisons where relevant
5. Do not fabricate statistics, gene names, or citations not present in the provided context

## Data Context

# Multi-Omics Integration and Cross-Tissue Analysis

## G1: Multi-Modal Phase Classification
- **Modalities fused**: Clinical (CBC + CMP) + Proteomics (PCA) + Metabolomics (PCA)
- **Matched samples**: 21 (only timepoints where all 3 modalities were collected)
- **Feature construction**:
  - Clinical: ~40 raw CBC + CMP features
  - Proteomics: PCA of 2,845 proteins → 8 components
  - Metabolomics: PCA of metabolite matrix → 8 components
  - Total: ~56 fused features (PCA applied per-fold to prevent data leakage)
- **Task**: 3-class phase classification (pre_flight / post_flight / recovery)
- **Evaluation**: LOCO (4-fold), macro_f1
- **Results**: LogReg=0.517, MLP=0.285, RF=0.254

## H1: Cross-Tissue Gene Conservation (PBMC → Skin)
- **Question**: Do PBMC DE patterns predict skin DE?
- **N**: 731 genes tested in both PBMC and skin
- **Features**: 9 I4 PBMC cell type log2FC values (CD4_T, CD8_T, other_T, B, NK, CD14_Mono, CD16_Mono, DC, other)
- **Target**: Whether gene is also significantly DE in skin (binary)
- **Metric**: AUPRC
- **Results**: RF=0.266, LogReg=0.176, MLP=0.062

## Key Observations
- Multi-modal fusion (G1) improves over single-modality approaches, but small N (21) limits gains
- PCA is necessary for proteomics and metabolomics (p >> n) but loses interpretability
- LOCO evaluation with N=21 means each fold tests on ~5 samples from one crew
- Cross-tissue conservation (H1) shows moderate signal: some genes respond systemically to spaceflight across both blood and skin
- RF best for H1, suggesting nonlinear relationships between PBMC cell type effects and skin DE

# Cross-Mission Comparison Data

## Missions Compared
| Property | Inspiration4 (I4) | NASA Twins Study |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Duration | 3 days | 340 days |
| Orbit | LEO (~585 km) | ISS (~408 km) |
| Crew | 4 civilians | 1 astronaut (twin control) |
| Year | 2021 | 2015-2016 |
| Blood analysis | cfRNA (cell-free), PBMC (single-cell) | Blood cell scRNA-seq (CD4, CD8, CD19, PBMC, LD) |

## NASA Twins Study Details
- **Subjects**: Scott Kelly (space) vs Mark Kelly (ground twin)
- **Experiment types**: Multivariate (PolyA+ and Ribodepleted together), PolyA+, Ribodepleted
- **Cell types**: CD4, CD8, CD19 (B cells), PBMC, LD (lymphocyte-depleted)
- **Contrasts**: 21 different coefficients including In-flight vs Pre-flight, Post-flight vs Pre-flight, In-flight vs Post-flight, GLM models for time effects
- **Total DEG entries**: 115,493 rows across all cell types, contrasts, and experiment types
- **Unique genes tested**: 19,446

## Cross-Mission Pathway Conservation (Task I2)
- **I4 PBMC GSEA**: 452 unique pathways enriched across 9 cell types (CD4_T, CD8_T, other_T, B, NK, CD14_Mono, CD16_Mono, DC, other)
- **Twins GSEA**: 152 unique pathways significant in CD4, CD8, CD19
- **Conserved**: 146 pathways found in both missions (32.3% of I4 pathways)
- **Key conserved pathways**: HALLMARK_OXIDATIVE_PHOSPHORYLATION, HALLMARK_MYC_TARGETS_V1, HALLMARK_UV_RESPONSE_DN
- **Features**: mean NES, std NES, mean ES, mean/min padj, number of cell types, pathway size, direction consistency

## Cross-Mission Gene DE Conservation (Task I3)
- **Shared gene universe**: 15,540 genes (intersection of Twins 19,446 and I4 cfRNA 26,845)
- **Conserved DE genes**: 814 (5.2%) — significant in both Twins blood cells and I4 cfRNA
- **Twins features per gene**: mean absolute log2FC, max absolute log2FC, mean base expression, mean lfcSE, mean absolute Wald statistic, number of cell types DE, number of contrasts DE, total DEG entries, direction consistency
- **I4 target**: cfRNA ANOVA FDR < 0.05

## Biological Significance
- Despite 100-fold difference in mission duration (3 days vs 340 days), 32.3% pathway overlap is remarkable
- Suggests core spaceflight stress pathways that activate regardless of duration
- Oxidative phosphorylation disruption is a hallmark of mitochondrial stress in microgravity
- MYC targets relate to cell proliferation changes observed in both missions
- The 5.2% gene-level conservation is lower than pathway-level, suggesting pathways capture broader biological themes while individual gene responses are more context-dependent

**Question (hard):** H1 uses 9 PBMC cell type log2FC values to predict skin DE. If a gene has high log2FC in CD14_Mono and CD16_Mono but low log2FC in T cells and B cells, what might this pattern mean for skin DE prediction?
