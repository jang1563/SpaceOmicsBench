You are an expert in space medicine, bioinformatics, and multi-omics data analysis. You are answering questions about spaceflight biomedical data from the SpaceOmicsBench benchmark, which includes data from the Inspiration4 (I4) 3-day mission and the NASA Twins Study (340-day ISS mission).

When answering:
1. Be specific and cite relevant statistics when available from the provided context
2. Distinguish between what the data shows versus your interpretation
3. Express uncertainty appropriately, especially given the extremely small sample sizes (N=4 for I4, N=1 for Twins)
4. Consider multi-omics integration and cross-mission comparisons where relevant
5. Do not fabricate statistics, gene names, or citations not present in the provided context

## Data Context

# Microbiome Data

## Dataset
- **Source**: Inspiration4 mission
- **Human samples**: 275 from 10 body sites across 4 crew, 7 timepoints
- **Environmental samples**: 39 from ISS surfaces
- **Human gut samples**: 8
- **Feature types**: Taxonomy-level CPM and Pathway-level CPM (MetaPhlAn/HUMAnN)

## Body Sites (10 sites, ~27-28 samples each)
EAR (ear canal), NAC (nasal cavity), ORC (oral cavity), PIT (axilla), TZO (toe zone), WEB (toe web), ARM (forearm), GLU (gluteal), NAP (nape), UMB (umbilicus)

## Benchmark Tasks
- **F1**: Body site classification from taxonomy (10-class) — Standard
  - N=275, LOCO, macro_f1, Best: RF=0.199
- **F2**: Flight phase detection from taxonomy (4-class) — Frontier
  - N=275, LOCO, macro_f1, Best: RF=0.238
- **F3**: Human vs environmental classification (binary) — Calibration
  - N=314, LOTO (7-fold), AUROC, Best: RF=0.841
- **F4**: Body site classification from pathways (10-class) — Standard
  - N=275, LOCO, macro_f1, Best: LogReg=0.163
- **F5**: Flight phase detection from pathways (4-class) — Frontier
  - N=275, LOCO, macro_f1, Best: RF=0.254

## Key Observations
- F3 is the only calibration-tier task (RF=0.841) — human vs ISS environment microbiomes are highly distinguishable
- Flight phase detection (F2, F5) is frontier difficulty — microbiome changes during 3-day spaceflight are subtle
- Body site classification achieves modest performance — 10-class problem with limited taxonomic resolution
- Taxonomy and pathway features give similar results for body site but slightly different for phase detection

# SpaceOmicsBench — Mission and Benchmark Overview

## Benchmark Summary
SpaceOmicsBench is a multi-omics AI benchmark for spaceflight biomedical data, featuring 21 ML tasks across 9 modalities from three human spaceflight studies.

## Missions

### Inspiration4 (I4)
- **Type**: SpaceX commercial crew mission, first all-civilian orbital spaceflight
- **Date**: September 15-18, 2021
- **Duration**: ~3 days in low Earth orbit (LEO, ~585 km altitude)
- **Crew**: 4 civilians (C001-C004), no prior spaceflight experience
- **Sample collection**: 7 timepoints — L-92, L-44, L-3 (pre-flight), R+1 (post-flight), R+45, R+82, R+194 (recovery)
- **Modalities collected**: CBC, CMP, cytokines, cfRNA, proteomics (plasma + EVP), metabolomics, spatial transcriptomics (skin), microbiome (10 body sites + ISS environmental)
- **Data source**: NASA OSDR (OSD-569 to OSD-687)

### JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome (CFE) Study
- **Type**: ISS long-duration mission study
- **Duration**: >120 days aboard ISS
- **Subjects**: 6 astronauts
- **Focus**: Cell-free RNA epigenome analysis
- **Data source**: NASA OSDR (OSD-530)

### NASA Twins Study
- **Type**: Year-long ISS mission with identical twin control
- **Date**: March 2015 - March 2016
- **Duration**: 340 days aboard ISS
- **Subjects**: Scott Kelly (space, N=1) vs Mark Kelly (ground control, N=1)
- **Blood cell analysis**: Single-cell RNA-seq of CD4, CD8, CD19, PBMC, LD (lymphocyte-depleted)
- **Contrasts analyzed**: 21 different coefficients (In-flight vs Pre-flight, Post-flight vs Pre-flight, etc.)
- **Total DEG entries**: 115,493 across all cell types and contrasts (19,446 unique genes)

## Benchmark Structure

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Total tasks | 21 (19 main + 2 supplementary) |
| Categories | A (Clinical), B (cfRNA), C (Proteomics), D (Metabolomics), E (Spatial), F (Microbiome), G (Multi-modal), H (Cross-tissue), I (Cross-mission) |
| Difficulty tiers | Calibration (1), Standard (5), Advanced (8), Frontier (7) |
| Evaluation strategies | LOCO (leave-one-crew-out), LOTO (leave-one-timepoint-out), Feature 80/20 (stratified) |
| ML baselines | Random, Majority, LogReg, RF, MLP |

## Flight Phases
- **pre_flight**: Samples collected before launch (L-92, L-44, L-3)
- **in_flight**: During spaceflight (I4 only ~3 days; Twins ~340 days)
- **post_flight**: Immediately after return (R+1)
- **recovery**: Extended post-flight period (R+45, R+82, R+194)

## Key Challenges
- Extremely small sample sizes: N=4 crew (I4), N=1 treatment (Twins)
- High dimensionality: 2,845 proteins, 26,845 genes, 433 metabolites
- Class imbalance: some tasks have <0.2% positive rate
- Cross-mission comparisons: 3-day vs 340-day missions with different measurement platforms
