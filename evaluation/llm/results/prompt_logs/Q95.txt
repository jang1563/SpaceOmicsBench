## Flight Phases
- **pre_flight**: Samples collected before launch (L-92, L-44, L-3)

## Key Challenges
- Extremely small sample sizes: N=4 crew (I4), N=1 treatment (Twins)
- High dimensionality: 2,845 proteins, 26,845 genes, 433 metabolites

# Spatial Transcriptomics Data

## Dataset
- **Source**: Inspiration4 skin biopsies
- **Genes**: 18,677 measured across skin tissue layers
- **Layers analyzed**: outer_epidermis, inner_epidermis, epidermis (combined), outer_dermis, vasculature

## All-Skin DE Analysis (Feature Source)
- Baseline DE statistics computed across entire skin tissue
- Features per gene: baseMean, log2FoldChange, lfcSE (standard error)
- These all-skin features serve as input for layer-specific prediction

## Layer-Specific DE (Labels)
- Separate DE analysis per skin layer
- Significance threshold: adjusted p-value < 0.05
- Positive counts: outer_epidermis ~35, epidermis ~40, inner_epidermis ~15, outer_dermis ~18

## Benchmark Tasks
- **E1**: Cross-layer DE prediction (outer_epidermis) — Advanced
  - N=18,677, positives=35 (0.19%), AUPRC, Best: LogReg=0.017
- **E4**: Cross-layer DE prediction (epidermis) — Advanced
  - N=18,677, positives=~40 (0.21%), AUPRC, Best: LogReg=0.023
- **E2**: Cross-layer DE (inner_epidermis) — Supplementary/Frontier
  - Extreme imbalance (~15 positives), metric instability expected
- **E3**: Cross-layer DE (outer_dermis) — Supplementary/Frontier
  - Extreme imbalance (~18 positives), Best: RF=0.223

## Key Observations
- Extreme class imbalance (0.1-0.2% positive rate) necessitates AUPRC metric
- All-skin DE features have limited power for predicting layer-specific effects
- Skin is directly exposed to space radiation; layer-specific responses may reflect depth-dependent radiation exposure
- E2/E3 are supplementary due to metric instability from very few positives

# Cell-Free RNA Transcriptomics

## I4 cfRNA Dataset
- **Genes measured**: 26,845 across 4 crew, 7 timepoints
- **Analysis**: 3-group differential expression (ANOVA + pairwise edge tests)
- **Groups**: pre-flight vs in-flight vs post-flight
- **DRR genes**: 466 differentially-regulated response genes identified (1.7% of total)

## Feature Set (29 features per gene)
- **Effect-size features**: fold-changes and mean differences for each pairwise comparison (pre vs flight, pre vs post, flight vs post)
- **Distribution features**: group means (normalized, raw, transformed), experiment-level range, IQR, fold-change, difference across all samples
- **No p-values included** (removed to prevent leakage)

## JAXA CFE Study
- 6 astronauts, >120 days ISS
- Cell-free RNA epigenome analysis
- Provides independent validation context for spaceflight transcriptomic changes

## Benchmark Tasks
- **B1**: Spaceflight-responsive gene ranking (binary: DRR vs non-DRR)
  - N=26,845, positives=466 (1.7%), metric=AUPRC
  - Feature 80/20 split (5 reps), seed=42
  - Best baseline: RF = 0.885
- **B2**: Coregulated gene cluster prediction (multilabel, 16 clusters)
  - N=466, metric=micro_f1
  - Best baseline: LogReg = 0.154

## B1 Feature Ablation Study
| Variant | LogReg | RF | MLP |
|---------|--------|----|-----|
| All 29 features | 0.533 | 0.885 | 0.839 |
| Effect-only (fold-change/diff) | 0.248 | 0.813 | 0.756 |
| No-effect (distribution only) | 0.527 | 0.863 | 0.865 |

**Key finding**: Distribution-based features (means, ranges, IQRs) carry most predictive signal. Removing effect-size features barely affects RF/MLP performance, confirming the task tests genuine biological pattern recognition rather than simple fold-change thresholding.

**Question (medium):** Several tasks use AUPRC instead of AUROC as the primary metric (B1, E1-E4, H1, I1, I3). What common characteristic of these tasks justifies AUPRC over AUROC?
