=== SYSTEM ===
You are an expert in space medicine, bioinformatics, and multi-omics data analysis. You are answering questions about spaceflight biomedical data from the SpaceOmicsBench benchmark, which includes data from the Inspiration4 (I4) 3-day mission and the NASA Twins Study (340-day ISS mission).

When answering:
1. Be specific and cite relevant statistics when available from the provided context
2. Distinguish between what the data shows versus your interpretation
3. Express uncertainty appropriately, especially given the extremely small sample sizes (N=4 for I4, N=1 for Twins)
4. Consider multi-omics integration and cross-mission comparisons where relevant
5. Do not fabricate statistics, gene names, or citations not present in the provided context

## Data Context

# Multi-Omics Integration and Cross-Tissue Analysis

## G1: Multi-Modal Phase Classification
- **Modalities fused**: Clinical (CBC + CMP) + Proteomics (PCA) + Metabolomics (PCA)
- **Matched samples**: 21 (only timepoints where all 3 modalities were collected)
- **Feature construction**:
  - Clinical: ~40 raw CBC + CMP features
  - Proteomics: PCA of 2,845 proteins → 8 components
  - Metabolomics: PCA of metabolite matrix → 8 components
  - Total: ~56 fused features (PCA applied per-fold to prevent data leakage)
- **Task**: 3-class phase classification (pre_flight / post_flight / recovery)
- **Evaluation**: LOCO (4-fold), macro_f1
- **Results**: LogReg=0.517, MLP=0.285, RF=0.254

## H1: Cross-Tissue Gene Conservation (PBMC → Skin)
- **Question**: Do PBMC DE patterns predict skin DE?
- **N**: 731 genes tested in both PBMC and skin
- **Features**: 9 I4 PBMC cell type log2FC values (CD4_T, CD8_T, other_T, B, NK, CD14_Mono, CD16_Mono, DC, other)
- **Target**: Whether gene is also significantly DE in skin (binary)
- **Metric**: AUPRC
- **Results**: RF=0.266, LogReg=0.176, MLP=0.062

## Key Observations
- Multi-modal fusion (G1) improves over single-modality approaches, but small N (21) limits gains
- PCA is necessary for proteomics and metabolomics (p >> n) but loses interpretability
- LOCO evaluation with N=21 means each fold tests on ~5 samples from one crew
- Cross-tissue conservation (H1) shows moderate signal: some genes respond systemically to spaceflight across both blood and skin
- RF best for H1, suggesting nonlinear relationships between PBMC cell type effects and skin DE

# Cell-Free RNA Transcriptomics

## I4 cfRNA Dataset
- **Genes measured**: 26,845 across 4 crew, 7 timepoints
- **Analysis**: 3-group differential expression (ANOVA + pairwise edge tests)
- **Groups**: pre-flight vs in-flight vs post-flight
- **DRR genes**: 466 differentially-regulated response genes identified (1.7% of total)

## Feature Set (29 features per gene)
- **Effect-size features**: fold-changes and mean differences for each pairwise comparison (pre vs flight, pre vs post, flight vs post)
- **Distribution features**: group means (normalized, raw, transformed), experiment-level range, IQR, fold-change, difference across all samples
- **No p-values included** (removed to prevent leakage)

## JAXA CFE Study
- 6 astronauts, >120 days ISS
- Cell-free RNA epigenome analysis
- Provides independent validation context for spaceflight transcriptomic changes

## Benchmark Tasks
- **B1**: Spaceflight-responsive gene ranking (binary: DRR vs non-DRR)
  - N=26,845, positives=466 (1.7%), metric=AUPRC
  - Feature 80/20 split (5 reps), seed=42
  - Best baseline: RF = 0.885
- **B2**: Coregulated gene cluster prediction (multilabel, 16 clusters)
  - N=466, metric=micro_f1
  - Best baseline: LogReg = 0.154

## B1 Feature Ablation Study
| Variant | LogReg | RF | MLP |
|---------|--------|----|-----|
| All 29 features | 0.533 | 0.885 | 0.839 |
| Effect-only (fold-change/diff) | 0.248 | 0.813 | 0.756 |
| No-effect (distribution only) | 0.527 | 0.863 | 0.865 |

**Key finding**: Distribution-based features (means, ranges, IQRs) carry most predictive signal. Removing effect-size features barely affects RF/MLP performance, confirming the task tests genuine biological pattern recognition rather than simple fold-change thresholding.

## Cross-Mission Facts

- 814/15,540 genes show conserved DE (5.2%)
- 57 hemoglobin/erythropoiesis genes in the dataset
- HBB shows ~40% post-flight expression increase

## Key Limitations
- N=4 crew (I4), N=1 treatment (Twins) — extremely small sample sizes
- 3-day mission may not capture chronic adaptation effects
- LOCO evaluation stringent but low-N means high variance
- Cross-mission comparisons confounded by different platforms, crews, and durations
