=== SYSTEM ===
You are an expert in space medicine, bioinformatics, and multi-omics data analysis. You are answering questions about spaceflight biomedical data from the SpaceOmicsBench benchmark, which includes data from the Inspiration4 (I4) 3-day mission and the NASA Twins Study (340-day ISS mission).

When answering:
1. Be specific and cite relevant statistics when available from the provided context
2. Distinguish between what the data shows versus your interpretation
3. Express uncertainty appropriately, especially given the extremely small sample sizes (N=4 for I4, N=1 for Twins)
4. Consider multi-omics integration and cross-mission comparisons where relevant
5. Do not fabricate statistics, gene names, or citations not present in the provided context

## Data Context

# Microbiome Data

## Dataset
- **Source**: Inspiration4 mission
- **Human samples**: 275 from 10 body sites across 4 crew, 7 timepoints
- **Environmental samples**: 39 from ISS surfaces
- **Human gut samples**: 8
- **Feature types**: Taxonomy-level CPM and Pathway-level CPM (MetaPhlAn/HUMAnN)

## Body Sites (10 sites, ~27-28 samples each)
EAR (ear canal), NAC (nasal cavity), ORC (oral cavity), PIT (axilla), TZO (toe zone), WEB (toe web), ARM (forearm), GLU (gluteal), NAP (nape), UMB (umbilicus)

## Benchmark Tasks
- **F1**: Body site classification from taxonomy (10-class) — Standard
  - N=275, LOCO, macro_f1, Best: RF=0.199
- **F2**: Flight phase detection from taxonomy (4-class) — Frontier
  - N=275, LOCO, macro_f1, Best: RF=0.238
- **F3**: Human vs environmental classification (binary) — Calibration
  - N=314, LOTO (7-fold), AUROC, Best: RF=0.841
- **F4**: Body site classification from pathways (10-class) — Standard
  - N=275, LOCO, macro_f1, Best: LogReg=0.163
- **F5**: Flight phase detection from pathways (4-class) — Frontier
  - N=275, LOCO, macro_f1, Best: RF=0.254

## Key Observations
- F3 is the only calibration-tier task (RF=0.841) — human vs ISS environment microbiomes are highly distinguishable
- Flight phase detection (F2, F5) is frontier difficulty — microbiome changes during 3-day spaceflight are subtle
- Body site classification achieves modest performance — 10-class problem with limited taxonomic resolution
- Taxonomy and pathway features give similar results for body site but slightly different for phase detection

# Multi-Omics Integration and Cross-Tissue Analysis

## G1: Multi-Modal Phase Classification
- **Modalities fused**: Clinical (CBC + CMP) + Proteomics (PCA) + Metabolomics (PCA)
- **Matched samples**: 21 (only timepoints where all 3 modalities were collected)
- **Feature construction**:
  - Clinical: ~40 raw CBC + CMP features
  - Proteomics: PCA of 2,845 proteins → 8 components
  - Metabolomics: PCA of metabolite matrix → 8 components
  - Total: ~56 fused features (PCA applied per-fold to prevent data leakage)
- **Task**: 3-class phase classification (pre_flight / post_flight / recovery)
- **Evaluation**: LOCO (4-fold), macro_f1
- **Results**: LogReg=0.517, MLP=0.285, RF=0.254

## H1: Cross-Tissue Gene Conservation (PBMC → Skin)
- **Question**: Do PBMC DE patterns predict skin DE?
- **N**: 731 genes tested in both PBMC and skin
- **Features**: 9 I4 PBMC cell type log2FC values (CD4_T, CD8_T, other_T, B, NK, CD14_Mono, CD16_Mono, DC, other)
- **Target**: Whether gene is also significantly DE in skin (binary)
- **Metric**: AUPRC
- **Results**: RF=0.266, LogReg=0.176, MLP=0.062

## Key Observations
- Multi-modal fusion (G1) improves over single-modality approaches, but small N (21) limits gains
- PCA is necessary for proteomics and metabolomics (p >> n) but loses interpretability
- LOCO evaluation with N=21 means each fold tests on ~5 samples from one crew
- Cross-tissue conservation (H1) shows moderate signal: some genes respond systemically to spaceflight across both blood and skin
- RF best for H1, suggesting nonlinear relationships between PBMC cell type effects and skin DE

## Cross-Mission Facts
- 146/452 pathways conserved between I4 and Twins (32.3%)
- 814/15,540 genes show conserved DE (5.2%)
- 57 hemoglobin/erythropoiesis genes in the dataset
- HBB shows ~40% post-flight expression increase

## Key Limitations
- N=4 crew (I4), N=1 treatment (Twins) — extremely small sample sizes
- 3-day mission may not capture chronic adaptation effects
- LOCO evaluation stringent but low-N means high variance
- Cross-mission comparisons confounded by different platforms, crews, and durations

**Question (expert):** If longitudinal gut microbiome samples had been collected (currently only 8 gut samples exist), and a gut dysbiosis index was computed, how would you integrate this into the multi-modal G1 task? What challenges would arise?
