=== SYSTEM ===
You are an expert in space medicine, bioinformatics, and multi-omics data analysis. You are answering questions about spaceflight biomedical data from the SpaceOmicsBench benchmark, which includes data from the Inspiration4 (I4) 3-day mission and the NASA Twins Study (340-day ISS mission).

When answering:
1. Be specific and cite relevant statistics when available from the provided context
2. Distinguish between what the data shows versus your interpretation
3. Express uncertainty appropriately, especially given the extremely small sample sizes (N=4 for I4, N=1 for Twins)
4. Consider multi-omics integration and cross-mission comparisons where relevant
5. Do not fabricate statistics, gene names, or citations not present in the provided context

## Data Context

# Spatial Transcriptomics Data

## Dataset
- **Source**: Inspiration4 skin biopsies
- **Genes**: 18,677 measured across skin tissue layers
- **Layers analyzed**: outer_epidermis, inner_epidermis, epidermis (combined), outer_dermis, vasculature

## All-Skin DE Analysis (Feature Source)
- Baseline DE statistics computed across entire skin tissue
- Features per gene: baseMean, log2FoldChange, lfcSE (standard error)
- These all-skin features serve as input for layer-specific prediction

## Layer-Specific DE (Labels)
- Separate DE analysis per skin layer
- Significance threshold: adjusted p-value < 0.05
- Positive counts: outer_epidermis ~35, epidermis ~40, inner_epidermis ~15, outer_dermis ~18

## Benchmark Tasks
- **E1**: Cross-layer DE prediction (outer_epidermis) — Advanced
  - N=18,677, positives=35 (0.19%), AUPRC, Best: LogReg=0.017
- **E4**: Cross-layer DE prediction (epidermis) — Advanced
  - N=18,677, positives=~40 (0.21%), AUPRC, Best: LogReg=0.023
- **E2**: Cross-layer DE (inner_epidermis) — Supplementary/Frontier
  - Extreme imbalance (~15 positives), metric instability expected
- **E3**: Cross-layer DE (outer_dermis) — Supplementary/Frontier
  - Extreme imbalance (~18 positives), Best: RF=0.223

## Key Observations
- Extreme class imbalance (0.1-0.2% positive rate) necessitates AUPRC metric
- All-skin DE features have limited power for predicting layer-specific effects
- Skin is directly exposed to space radiation; layer-specific responses may reflect depth-dependent radiation exposure
- E2/E3 are supplementary due to metric instability from very few positives

# Proteomics Data

## Plasma Proteomics
- **Samples**: 21 (4 crew × ~5-6 timepoints, plasma tissue)
- **Proteins measured**: 2,845
- **DE analysis**: 1,686 proteins with differential expression statistics (logFC, AveExpr, t-statistic, B-statistic, adj_pval)

## EVP (Extracellular Vesicle Particle) Proteomics
- **DE analysis**: 496 proteins with DE statistics
- **Overlap with plasma**: 380 proteins measured in both biofluids

## Benchmark Tasks
- **C1**: Proteomics phase classification (3-class: pre/post/recovery)
  - N=21 samples, per-fold PCA reduction (2,845 proteins → 10 components)
  - Metric: macro_f1, LOCO evaluation (4-fold)
  - Best baseline: MLP = 0.517
- **C2**: Cross-biofluid protein DE concordance (frontier difficulty)
  - Predict EVP significance from plasma DE features
  - N=380 overlapping proteins, metric=AUROC
  - Best baseline: LightGBM = 0.565 (barely above random 0.529)

## Key Observations
- p >> n problem: 2,845 proteins vs 21 samples requires PCA dimensionality reduction
- C1 achieves reasonable classification despite tiny N, suggesting strong proteomic shifts during spaceflight
- C2 is frontier difficulty — plasma and EVP protein changes show weak concordance, reflecting different biological compartments
- EVP cargo represents active cellular secretion, while plasma includes both secreted and leaked proteins

# Metabolomics Data

## Dataset
- **Source**: Inspiration4 mission
- **Metabolites**: 433 measured across 4 crew, multiple timepoints
- **Analytical modes**: ANP-POS and RP-POS mass spectrometry
- **Spaceflight-responsive**: 91/433 metabolites (21%) show significant DE

## Features per Metabolite
- **Mass**: molecular mass from MS
- **RT**: retention time
- **annotation_confidence**: quality of metabolite identification
- **SuperPathway**: broad metabolic category
- **SubPathway**: specific metabolic pathway
- **Formula**: chemical formula (decomposed into C, H, N, O, S, P atom counts)

## Benchmark Task
- **D1**: Metabolite spaceflight response prediction (binary)
  - N=433, positives=91 (21%), metric=AUROC
  - Feature 80/20 split (5 reps)
  - Best baseline: RF = 0.676

## Key Observations
- Moderate positive rate (21%) makes this amenable to AUROC evaluation
- Chemical structure features (atom counts) provide physicochemical context
- Pathway annotations enable biological interpretation of predictions
- Short-duration (3-day) metabolomic changes likely reflect acute stress response rather than chronic adaptation
