## Missions Compared
| Property | Inspiration4 (I4) | NASA Twins Study |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Duration | 3 days | 340 days |
| Orbit | LEO (~585 km) | ISS (~408 km) |
| Crew | 4 civilians | 1 astronaut (twin control) |
| Year | 2021 | 2015-2016 |
| Blood analysis | cfRNA (cell-free), PBMC (single-cell) | Blood cell scRNA-seq (CD4, CD8, CD19, PBMC, LD) |

## NASA Twins Study Details
- **Subjects**: Scott Kelly (space) vs Mark Kelly (ground twin)
- **Experiment types**: Multivariate (PolyA+ and Ribodepleted together), PolyA+, Ribodepleted
- **Cell types**: CD4, CD8, CD19 (B cells), PBMC, LD (lymphocyte-depleted)
- **Contrasts**: 21 different coefficients including In-flight vs Pre-flight, Post-flight vs Pre-flight, In-flight vs Post-flight, GLM models for time effects
- **Total DEG entries**: 115,493 rows across all cell types, contrasts, and experiment types
- **Unique genes tested**: 19,446

## Cross-Mission Pathway Conservation (Task I2)
- **I4 PBMC GSEA**: 452 unique pathways enriched across 9 cell types (CD4_T, CD8_T, other_T, B, NK, CD14_Mono, CD16_Mono, DC, other)
- **Twins GSEA**: 152 unique pathways significant in CD4, CD8, CD19
- **Conserved**: 146 pathways found in both missions (32.3% of I4 pathways)
- **Key conserved pathways**: HALLMARK_OXIDATIVE_PHOSPHORYLATION, HALLMARK_MYC_TARGETS_V1, HALLMARK_UV_RESPONSE_DN
- **Features**: mean NES, std NES, mean ES, mean/min padj, number of cell types, pathway size, direction consistency

## Cross-Mission Gene DE Conservation (Task I3)
- **Shared gene universe**: 15,540 genes (intersection of Twins 19,446 and I4 cfRNA 26,845)
- **Conserved DE genes**: 814 (5.2%) — significant in both Twins blood cells and I4 cfRNA
- **Twins features per gene**: mean absolute log2FC, max absolute log2FC, mean base expression, mean lfcSE, mean absolute Wald statistic, number of cell types DE, number of contrasts DE, total DEG entries, direction consistency
- **I4 target**: cfRNA ANOVA FDR < 0.05

## Biological Significance
- Despite 100-fold difference in mission duration (3 days vs 340 days), 32.3% pathway overlap is remarkable
- Suggests core spaceflight stress pathways that activate regardless of duration
- Oxidative phosphorylation disruption is a hallmark of mitochondrial stress in microgravity
- MYC targets relate to cell proliferation changes observed in both missions
- The 5.2% gene-level conservation is lower than pathway-level, suggesting pathways capture broader biological themes while individual gene responses are more context-dependent

# Space Anemia and Hemoglobin Pathway

## Background
Space anemia is a well-documented consequence of spaceflight. Key findings from literature:
- ~54% more red blood cells destroyed in space compared to ground (Trudel et al., Nature Medicine 2022)
- Hemolysis continues for at least 1 year post-flight
- Compensatory erythropoiesis upregulates hemoglobin-related genes

## Hemoglobin Gene Set
- **Total genes**: 59 hemoglobin/erythropoiesis pathway genes
- **Key genes**: HBA1, HBA2 (alpha-globins), HBB (beta-globin), HBBP1, ALAS2 (rate-limiting erythropoiesis enzyme)
- **Overlap with DE data**: 57 of 59 genes found in the 26,845-gene Twins DE dataset

## Expression Data (from gt_hemoglobin_globin_genes.csv)
- 59 genes measured across 4 crew and 11 timepoints (Pre1-3, Flight1-4, Post1-4)
- HBB expression: normalized means range from ~11,000 (Flight2) to ~33,000 (Post4), showing ~40% post-flight increase
- HBA1 and HBA2 show similar patterns: decreased during flight, increased post-flight
- ALAS2 (aminolevulinic acid synthase 2): key rate-limiting enzyme for heme biosynthesis

## Cross-Mission DE (Task I1)
- **Features**: 3 fold-change values from Twins transcriptome (Pre vs Flight FC, Pre vs Post FC, Flight vs Post FC)
- **Target**: Whether gene is in the 57 hemoglobin/erythropoiesis gene set
- **N=26,845**, positives=57 (0.21%)
- **Metric**: AUPRC
- **Difficulty**: Frontier — only 3 features with extreme class imbalance
- **Baseline results**: RF=0.005, LogReg=0.003 (near random=0.003)

## Biological Interpretation
- Alpha-globin (HBA1, HBA2) and beta-globin (HBB) are the main oxygen-carrying proteins in hemoglobin
- Spaceflight causes splenic hemolysis → compensatory upregulation of erythropoiesis genes
- The post-flight increase is consistent with recovery response: body producing new RBCs to replace those lost in space
- ALAS2 upregulation confirms active heme biosynthesis pathway activation
- Cross-mission consistency (both I4 and Twins show hemoglobin pathway activation) suggests this is a universal spaceflight response

## Cross-Mission Facts
- 146/452 pathways conserved between I4 and Twins (32.3%)
- 814/15,540 genes show conserved DE (5.2%)

## Key Limitations
- N=4 crew (I4), N=1 treatment (Twins) — extremely small sample sizes
- 3-day mission may not capture chronic adaptation effects
- LOCO evaluation stringent but low-N means high variance
- Cross-mission comparisons confounded by different platforms, crews, and durations

**Question (expert):** If you could add a third mission dataset (e.g., a 30-day lunar orbit mission with 6 crew), how would you redesign the I-series cross-mission tasks to leverage three-way comparisons? What new biological insights could emerge?
