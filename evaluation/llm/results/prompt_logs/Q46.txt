=== SYSTEM ===
You are an expert in space medicine, bioinformatics, and multi-omics data analysis. You are answering questions about spaceflight biomedical data from the SpaceOmicsBench benchmark, which includes data from the Inspiration4 (I4) 3-day mission and the NASA Twins Study (340-day ISS mission).

When answering:
1. Be specific and cite relevant statistics when available from the provided context
2. Distinguish between what the data shows versus your interpretation
3. Express uncertainty appropriately, especially given the extremely small sample sizes (N=4 for I4, N=1 for Twins)
4. Consider multi-omics integration and cross-mission comparisons where relevant
5. Do not fabricate statistics, gene names, or citations not present in the provided context

## Data Context

# Space Anemia and Hemoglobin Pathway

## Background
Space anemia is a well-documented consequence of spaceflight. Key findings from literature:
- ~54% more red blood cells destroyed in space compared to ground (Trudel et al., Nature Medicine 2022)
- Hemolysis continues for at least 1 year post-flight
- Compensatory erythropoiesis upregulates hemoglobin-related genes

## Hemoglobin Gene Set
- **Total genes**: 59 hemoglobin/erythropoiesis pathway genes
- **Key genes**: HBA1, HBA2 (alpha-globins), HBB (beta-globin), HBBP1, ALAS2 (rate-limiting erythropoiesis enzyme)
- **Overlap with DE data**: 57 of 59 genes found in the 26,845-gene Twins DE dataset

## Expression Data (from gt_hemoglobin_globin_genes.csv)
- 59 genes measured across 4 crew and 11 timepoints (Pre1-3, Flight1-4, Post1-4)
- HBB expression: normalized means range from ~11,000 (Flight2) to ~33,000 (Post4), showing ~40% post-flight increase
- HBA1 and HBA2 show similar patterns: decreased during flight, increased post-flight
- ALAS2 (aminolevulinic acid synthase 2): key rate-limiting enzyme for heme biosynthesis

## Cross-Mission DE (Task I1)
- **Features**: 3 fold-change values from Twins transcriptome (Pre vs Flight FC, Pre vs Post FC, Flight vs Post FC)
- **Target**: Whether gene is in the 57 hemoglobin/erythropoiesis gene set
- **N=26,845**, positives=57 (0.21%)
- **Metric**: AUPRC
- **Difficulty**: Frontier — only 3 features with extreme class imbalance
- **Baseline results**: RF=0.005, LogReg=0.003 (near random=0.003)

## Biological Interpretation
- Alpha-globin (HBA1, HBA2) and beta-globin (HBB) are the main oxygen-carrying proteins in hemoglobin
- Spaceflight causes splenic hemolysis → compensatory upregulation of erythropoiesis genes
- The post-flight increase is consistent with recovery response: body producing new RBCs to replace those lost in space
- ALAS2 upregulation confirms active heme biosynthesis pathway activation
- Cross-mission consistency (both I4 and Twins show hemoglobin pathway activation) suggests this is a universal spaceflight response

# Cross-Mission Comparison Data

## Missions Compared
| Property | Inspiration4 (I4) | NASA Twins Study |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Duration | 3 days | 340 days |
| Orbit | LEO (~585 km) | ISS (~408 km) |
| Crew | 4 civilians | 1 astronaut (twin control) |
| Year | 2021 | 2015-2016 |
| Blood analysis | cfRNA (cell-free), PBMC (single-cell) | Blood cell scRNA-seq (CD4, CD8, CD19, PBMC, LD) |

## NASA Twins Study Details
- **Subjects**: Scott Kelly (space) vs Mark Kelly (ground twin)
- **Experiment types**: Multivariate (PolyA+ and Ribodepleted together), PolyA+, Ribodepleted
- **Cell types**: CD4, CD8, CD19 (B cells), PBMC, LD (lymphocyte-depleted)
- **Contrasts**: 21 different coefficients including In-flight vs Pre-flight, Post-flight vs Pre-flight, In-flight vs Post-flight, GLM models for time effects
- **Total DEG entries**: 115,493 rows across all cell types, contrasts, and experiment types
- **Unique genes tested**: 19,446

## Cross-Mission Pathway Conservation (Task I2)
- **I4 PBMC GSEA**: 452 unique pathways enriched across 9 cell types (CD4_T, CD8_T, other_T, B, NK, CD14_Mono, CD16_Mono, DC, other)
- **Twins GSEA**: 152 unique pathways significant in CD4, CD8, CD19
- **Conserved**: 146 pathways found in both missions (32.3% of I4 pathways)
- **Key conserved pathways**: HALLMARK_OXIDATIVE_PHOSPHORYLATION, HALLMARK_MYC_TARGETS_V1, HALLMARK_UV_RESPONSE_DN
- **Features**: mean NES, std NES, mean ES, mean/min padj, number of cell types, pathway size, direction consistency

## Cross-Mission Gene DE Conservation (Task I3)
- **Shared gene universe**: 15,540 genes (intersection of Twins 19,446 and I4 cfRNA 26,845)
- **Conserved DE genes**: 814 (5.2%) — significant in both Twins blood cells and I4 cfRNA
- **Twins features per gene**: mean absolute log2FC, max absolute log2FC, mean base expression, mean lfcSE, mean absolute Wald statistic, number of cell types DE, number of contrasts DE, total DEG entries, direction consistency
- **I4 target**: cfRNA ANOVA FDR < 0.05

## Biological Significance
- Despite 100-fold difference in mission duration (3 days vs 340 days), 32.3% pathway overlap is remarkable
- Suggests core spaceflight stress pathways that activate regardless of duration
- Oxidative phosphorylation disruption is a hallmark of mitochondrial stress in microgravity
- MYC targets relate to cell proliferation changes observed in both missions
- The 5.2% gene-level conservation is lower than pathway-level, suggesting pathways capture broader biological themes while individual gene responses are more context-dependent

**Question (hard):** The hemoglobin gene set shows consistent upregulation in both I4 (3-day) and Twins (340-day) missions. Does this similarity suggest that space anemia develops within 3 days, or could there be alternative explanations?
