=== SYSTEM ===
You are an expert in space medicine, bioinformatics, and multi-omics data analysis. You are answering questions about spaceflight biomedical data from the SpaceOmicsBench benchmark, which includes data from the Inspiration4 (I4) 3-day mission and the NASA Twins Study (340-day ISS mission).

When answering:
1. Be specific and cite relevant statistics when available from the provided context
2. Distinguish between what the data shows versus your interpretation
3. Express uncertainty appropriately, especially given the extremely small sample sizes (N=4 for I4, N=1 for Twins)
4. Consider multi-omics integration and cross-mission comparisons where relevant
5. Do not fabricate statistics, gene names, or citations not present in the provided context

## Data Context

# Metabolomics Data

## Dataset
- **Source**: Inspiration4 mission
- **Metabolites**: 433 measured across 4 crew, multiple timepoints
- **Analytical modes**: ANP-POS and RP-POS mass spectrometry
- **Spaceflight-responsive**: 91/433 metabolites (21%) show significant DE

## Features per Metabolite
- **Mass**: molecular mass from MS
- **RT**: retention time
- **annotation_confidence**: quality of metabolite identification
- **SuperPathway**: broad metabolic category
- **SubPathway**: specific metabolic pathway
- **Formula**: chemical formula (decomposed into C, H, N, O, S, P atom counts)

## Benchmark Task
- **D1**: Metabolite spaceflight response prediction (binary)
  - N=433, positives=91 (21%), metric=AUROC
  - Feature 80/20 split (5 reps)
  - Best baseline: RF = 0.676

## Key Observations
- Moderate positive rate (21%) makes this amenable to AUROC evaluation
- Chemical structure features (atom counts) provide physicochemical context
- Pathway annotations enable biological interpretation of predictions
- Short-duration (3-day) metabolomic changes likely reflect acute stress response rather than chronic adaptation

# Ground Truth Key Facts

## Mission Facts
- I4: 4 civilian crew, 3 days LEO (~585 km), September 2021, SpaceX Dragon
- NASA Twins: 340 days ISS, Scott Kelly vs Mark Kelly (twin control), 2015-2016
- JAXA CFE: 6 astronauts, >120 days ISS, cell-free RNA epigenome

## Benchmark Statistics
- 21 ML tasks: 19 main + 2 supplementary (E2, E3)
- 9 categories: Clinical, cfRNA, Proteomics, Metabolomics, Spatial, Microbiome, Multi-modal, Cross-tissue, Cross-mission
- Tiers: Calibration=1, Standard=5, Advanced=9, Frontier=6

| I1 | Frontier | LightGBM | 0.006 |
| I2 | Advanced | LightGBM | 0.735 |
| I3 | Advanced | LogReg | 0.090 |

## Composite Scores (Normalized)
- RF: 0.258 (best overall)
- XGBoost: 0.250
- LightGBM: 0.238
- LogReg: 0.201
- MLP: 0.133

## Cross-Mission Facts
- 146/452 pathways conserved between I4 and Twins (32.3%)
- 814/15,540 genes show conserved DE (5.2%)
- 57 hemoglobin/erythropoiesis genes in the dataset
- HBB shows ~40% post-flight expression increase

## Key Limitations
- N=4 crew (I4), N=1 treatment (Twins) — extremely small sample sizes
- 3-day mission may not capture chronic adaptation effects
- LOCO evaluation stringent but low-N means high variance
- Cross-mission comparisons confounded by different platforms, crews, and durations

**Question (hard):** The chemical formula features in D1 decompose molecular formulas into atom counts (C, H, N, O, S, P). What types of spaceflight-responsive metabolites might these simple features help identify, and what biochemistry would they miss?
