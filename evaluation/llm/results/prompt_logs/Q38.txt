You are an expert in space medicine, bioinformatics, and multi-omics data analysis. You are answering questions about spaceflight biomedical data from the SpaceOmicsBench benchmark, which includes data from the Inspiration4 (I4) 3-day mission and the NASA Twins Study (340-day ISS mission).

When answering:
1. Be specific and cite relevant statistics when available from the provided context
2. Distinguish between what the data shows versus your interpretation
3. Express uncertainty appropriately, especially given the extremely small sample sizes (N=4 for I4, N=1 for Twins)
4. Consider multi-omics integration and cross-mission comparisons where relevant
5. Do not fabricate statistics, gene names, or citations not present in the provided context

## Data Context

# Cross-Mission Comparison Data

## Missions Compared
| Property | Inspiration4 (I4) | NASA Twins Study |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Duration | 3 days | 340 days |
| Orbit | LEO (~585 km) | ISS (~408 km) |
| Crew | 4 civilians | 1 astronaut (twin control) |
| Year | 2021 | 2015-2016 |
| Blood analysis | cfRNA (cell-free), PBMC (single-cell) | Blood cell scRNA-seq (CD4, CD8, CD19, PBMC, LD) |

## NASA Twins Study Details
- **Subjects**: Scott Kelly (space) vs Mark Kelly (ground twin)
- **Experiment types**: Multivariate (PolyA+ and Ribodepleted together), PolyA+, Ribodepleted
- **Cell types**: CD4, CD8, CD19 (B cells), PBMC, LD (lymphocyte-depleted)
- **Contrasts**: 21 different coefficients including In-flight vs Pre-flight, Post-flight vs Pre-flight, In-flight vs Post-flight, GLM models for time effects
- **Total DEG entries**: 115,493 rows across all cell types, contrasts, and experiment types
- **Unique genes tested**: 19,446

## Cross-Mission Pathway Conservation (Task I2)
- **I4 PBMC GSEA**: 452 unique pathways enriched across 9 cell types (CD4_T, CD8_T, other_T, B, NK, CD14_Mono, CD16_Mono, DC, other)
- **Twins GSEA**: 152 unique pathways significant in CD4, CD8, CD19
- **Conserved**: 146 pathways found in both missions (32.3% of I4 pathways)
- **Key conserved pathways**: HALLMARK_OXIDATIVE_PHOSPHORYLATION, HALLMARK_MYC_TARGETS_V1, HALLMARK_UV_RESPONSE_DN
- **Features**: mean NES, std NES, mean ES, mean/min padj, number of cell types, pathway size, direction consistency

## Cross-Mission Gene DE Conservation (Task I3)
- **Shared gene universe**: 15,540 genes (intersection of Twins 19,446 and I4 cfRNA 26,845)
- **Conserved DE genes**: 814 (5.2%) — significant in both Twins blood cells and I4 cfRNA
- **Twins features per gene**: mean absolute log2FC, max absolute log2FC, mean base expression, mean lfcSE, mean absolute Wald statistic, number of cell types DE, number of contrasts DE, total DEG entries, direction consistency
- **I4 target**: cfRNA ANOVA FDR < 0.05

## Biological Significance
- Despite 100-fold difference in mission duration (3 days vs 340 days), 32.3% pathway overlap is remarkable
- Suggests core spaceflight stress pathways that activate regardless of duration
- Oxidative phosphorylation disruption is a hallmark of mitochondrial stress in microgravity
- MYC targets relate to cell proliferation changes observed in both missions
- The 5.2% gene-level conservation is lower than pathway-level, suggesting pathways capture broader biological themes while individual gene responses are more context-dependent

## Cross-Mission Facts
- 146/452 pathways conserved between I4 and Twins (32.3%)
- 814/15,540 genes show conserved DE (5.2%)
- 57 hemoglobin/erythropoiesis genes in the dataset
- HBB shows ~40% post-flight expression increase

## Key Limitations
- N=4 crew (I4), N=1 treatment (Twins) — extremely small sample sizes
- 3-day mission may not capture chronic adaptation effects
- LOCO evaluation stringent but low-N means high variance
- Cross-mission comparisons confounded by different platforms, crews, and durations

**Question (medium):** Gene-level DE conservation (814/15,540 = 5.2%) is much lower than pathway-level conservation (146/452 = 32.3%). Why would pathways be more conserved than individual genes across missions?
