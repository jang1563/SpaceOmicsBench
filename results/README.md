# Results Directory

This directory contains **example outputs** from local evaluation runs.
It is **not** the canonical benchmark leaderboard.

For baseline reference scores, see `baselines/baseline_results.json`.
For publishing your own model results, place them in a separate directory and cite the exact model/config used.

Git policy: files under `results/` are ignored (except this README). A single tracked sample output is stored at `docs/samples/result_sample_eval.json`.
